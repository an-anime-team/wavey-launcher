<h2 align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è Game is not playable at the current state of the launcher ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>

Due to expected changes from the game's side, current launcher version doesn't support its anti-cheat. I'm not going to update it to support temporary workarounds.
Manualy launching methods could be found in our discord server. Please don't use this app until it's updated.

Repository will be archived until proper solution is found.
